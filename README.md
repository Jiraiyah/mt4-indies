#What is MetaTrader 4 (MT4)
MetaTrader 4 is a retail trading platform commonly used by retail traders to trade Foreign Exchange (FX) and Contracts
For Difference (CFDs). You can learn more about MetaTrader from the the MetaQuotes 
[website](http://www.metaquotes.net/).

#Repository Structure
Each indicator, or group of indicators, are kept in a sub-folder. Some of the indicators have dependecies - these 
are listed each the READ ME file. The subfolders are structre in similar fashion to the MT4 experts folder. 

**Availble now:**
* **Correlation**: Indicators for comparing the correlation coefficient between symbols and on multiple timeframes.

**Coming soon:**
* **COT**: Commitments of Traders (COT) indicator(s) under development (see www.cftc.gov for more infomration).
* **Spread**: A basic indcator display some information about the symbol, spread etc (almost ready to publish).
* **Paulus1M1T**: An experiment in deriving expectancy from a basic mechanical system. The 1 minute 1 trade indicator 
implements a method outlined in a thread on Forex Factory. My implementation of this system as indicator is **NOT** an 
endorsement of it or as a trading system - it was just an experiment. (needs some code clean up).
