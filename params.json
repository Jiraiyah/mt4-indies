You can learn more about MetaTrader from the the MetaQuotes \r\n[website](http://www.metaquotes.net/).\r\n\r\n#Repository Structure\r\nEach indicator, or group of indicators, are kept in a sub-folder. Some of the indicators have dependecies - these \r\nare listed each the READ ME file. The subfolders are structre in similar fashion to the MT4 experts folder. \r\n\r\n**Availble now:**\r\n* **Correlation**: Indicators for comparing the correlation coefficient between symbols and on multiple timeframes.\r\n\r\n**Coming soon:**\r\n* **COT**: Commitments of Traders (COT) indicator(s) under development (see www.cftc.gov for more infomration).\r\n* **Spread**: A basic indcator display some information about the symbol, spread etc (almost ready to publish).\r\n* **Paulus1M1T**: An experiment in deriving expectancy for a basic mechanical system from within MT4. The 1 minute 1 trade \r\nindicator implements a method outlined in a thread on Forex Factory. My implementation of this system as indicator is \r\n**NOT** an endorsement of the thread or the trading system - it was just an experiment. (needs some code clean up).\r\n\r\n\r\n#References\r\nHere are some useful links:\r\n* [Forex Factory](http://wwwforexfactory.com): Is a great source of trading ideas, MT4 help and general trader talk.\r\n* [Steve Hopwood's FX forum](http://www.stevehopwoodforex.com/): Has lots of information and a supportive community for anyone wanting to build an indicators, experts etc.\r\n* [Visual Studio Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products): Visual Studio (even though its Microsoft product) is a great IDE and hey its the easiest way to build DLLs.\r\n* I'd put www.ninety47.com here buts its not even under construction yet :)\r\n\r\n#Feedback\r\nIf you like this code let me know by following me here and on twitter [@ninety47](https://twitter.com/ninety47).\r\n","google":"UA-35919660-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
